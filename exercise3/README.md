## ✨️ Exercise Instruction
Create a personal portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS that demonstrates your understanding of key CSS concepts.
Please review the attached video for an example of the project.
:Apply different positioning methods (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky) to elements on your page, such as sections or project cards.Use padding, margins, width, height, and borders to style your sections and elements.Add a background image to one section and experiment with different background-size, background-position, and background-repeat properties.Implement hover, active, and focus effects on elements like buttons, links, or skill list items.Customize colors, fonts, and background properties to enhance the design of your page.Use various selectors (class, ID, element) and understand how specificity impacts which styles are applied.

Submit the HTML and CSS files (on Github, and post a link to the repo here), along with a screenshot of the rendered page.
